# Recycling Tech Hardware

Ethical consistency is something I strive for, and occasionally I discover places where one part of my life unexpectedly intersects with another. In this case the topic of recycling old tech hardware, something I dealt with frequently at $MSP, has intersected with my personal stance on Environmentalism.

When it comes to things like Big Oil, fracking, and pollution, a popular progressive opinion, my opinion, is that it’s unfair for companies to externalize their environmental impact — which is to say it’s unfair for companies to cut costs by polluting. It’s unfair because while the company may save money, the cost is simply transferred to the public that suffers the consequences of the environmental impact, whether that be healthcare, agriculture, or something else. It’s my opinion that if you have a barrel of waste, you should take on the costs to dispose of it in a way that does not cause harm/cost to others. If there is no safe disposal, the costs of obtaining it in the first place should be prohibitively expensive.

So what’s that have to do with IT? Ethically disposing of old hardware, and before that, respecting them as the bundles of rare non-renewable resources that they are, should be a goal of a business of any size. Today we worry about printing unnecessary reams of paper — but trees grow back, unlike the components inside a computer. So we should be at least as concerned about wasteful use of tech hardware as we are of renewable, recyclable, paper.

In my experience, people only like to recycle if it’s convenient to do so. Breaking yourself of that mindset is difficult, but I think it’s imperative if you want to operate with any integrity. At present, recycling computers is not cost-neutral, the value of raw materials recovered from recycling does not outweigh the cost of processing the old hardware. It’s not profitable to run a recycling business unless you charge your customers or seek grants or other support (not a scalable or long-term solution).

So, all that’s to say that recycling is expensive and time-consuming, but it is also ethical and necessary. It’s a cost of doing business that I can not externalize if I want to be ethically consistent.
